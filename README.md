# CMPE258 Final Project: Personal Workout Analyzer
Gym Workout Analyzer , an AI driven smart application which provides real-time, personalized feedback on workout form based on video input from a smartphone camera, enhancing safety and performance without the need for a personal trainer.

## Quick Start: Google Colab Evaluation Notebook 
To quickly evaluate our pre-trained models and compare the performance of the 3D Resnet, Posenet, you can use our Google Colab notebook:

[Workout Analyzer Evaluation Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oAgZINkBty7PPl6fPhjBNRf4VsDLdPs6#scrollTo=62ufHRjf7Ayf)

This notebook provides step-by-step instructions to load the trained models and evaluate them. The entire process takes less than 15 minutes to complete.


### Project Structure
- src/training.ipynb: Contains the implementation and training code of Resnet and Posenet
- src/Testing.ipynb: Contains the implementation of the Minimax agent
- src/input_videos: Contains the input testing videos top test the model
- src/output_videos: Contains the generated output videos with form analysis and confidence score

### Usage
Usage and running and testing of the model explained in the Testing notebook:


### Configuration
- These is no specific configuration to make for testing this code, you can find instrictions in testing notebook in the shared link, and you can easily run it.
